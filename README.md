# Getting Started with Nexus Valley

This project was bootstrapped with React router. MongoDB is used for database and Heroku is used for server site code and client site is deployed in the Firebase. This is a ecommerce project. Anyone can order only one product at a time after google login, and see all the order in the order page and also manage order in the admin palen area. 
You can visit that site from here... [Nexus Valley](https://nexus-valley.web.app/).
