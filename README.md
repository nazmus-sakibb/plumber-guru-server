# Getting Started with PlumberGuru

This project was bootstrapped with React router. MongoDB is used for database and Heroku is used for server site code and client site is deployed in the Firebase. This is a plumber service project. Anyone can book one service at a time after google login and pay with stripe, and see all the bookings in the booking list section. An admin can manage order and also make new admin in the admin palen area. This is the server site code repository.
You can visit that site from here... [PlumberGuru](https://plumber-guru.web.app/).
